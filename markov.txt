One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from the country caters
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a Hummer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beef in there, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer

Look in my eyes, tell me a tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side
All I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage
And save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted

They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild
Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do it for streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights, got 52 weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me beat and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink
